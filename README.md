You can use all transports built on top of [queue-interop](https://github.com/queue-interop/queue-interop) including [all supported](https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev/tree/master/docs/transport) by Enqueue.
It also supports extended AMQP features such as queue declaration and message delaying.    

The package allows you to use queue interop transport the [laravel way](https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev/blob/master/docs/laravel/queues.md) as well as integrates the [enqueue simple client](https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev/blob/master/docs/laravel/quick_tour.md#enqueue-simple-client).
